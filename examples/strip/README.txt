Notes for test example 2 (B field strip)

1. Imaging particles have energy W = 3.3 MeV, with associated speed V = 2.51e9 cm/s (this includes the relativistic speed correction).

2. The ellipsoidal blob is contained in a volume, side length li = 0.1 cm;

3. The distance ri from proton source to the edge of the magnetic field configuration is ri = 1 cm.

4. The distance rs from magnetic field configuration to screen is rs = 30 cm.

5. The magnification used is M = (rs+ri+0.5*li)/(ri+0.5*li).

6. The z-axis points into the screen - which means that Bxpath = - (mp*c/qe)*wBx; Bypath = (mp*c/qe)*wBx (mp = 1.67e-24 g; qe = 4.803e-10 statcoulomb; c = 3.0e10 cm/s).

7. Bxpathact, Bypathact have units of G cm; wBx, wBy have units of cm/s.
